### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jose Miguel and I'm a Software Engineer in Madrid, Spain.
I love the tech world, running and photography. In my personal time I try to learn new things all the time and create personal projects that are challenging in terms of programming and design.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VueJS with TypeScript.
