### Hi👋, I'm Jose Miguel, a Software Engineer based in Madrid, Spain 🚀

I'm passionate about technology 👨🏻‍💻, running 🏃🏻‍♂️, and biking 🚴‍♂️. In my free time, I love learning new things and working on personal projects that challenge my programming skills using languages like Java, Python, and TypeScript.

I specialize in enterprise applications using Spring Boot, with capabilities for message exchange via message queues (Kafka), REST, and SOAP services. I stay focused 🎯 on system performance, best practices, and testing.
